	[ Doc ]
	- This plugin is now deprecated. Use [Test::ReportPrereqs] instead.

	[ Meta ]

1.10    2013-10-03    DOLMEN (Olivier Mengué)

	[ Fixes ]
	- RT#88083: do not report dependencies listed only as 'develop'.
	  Thanks to Karen Etheridge, Kent Frederic, Graham Knop for raising
	  this issue!

1.09    2013-07-27    DOLMEN (Olivier Mengué)

	[ Doc ]
	- Add CAVEATS and SEE ALSO sections in POD. Read them!
	  Thanks to David Golden, Karen Etheridge and Caleb Cushing for raising
	  those issues!

	[ Tests ]
	- Use Test::Deep instead of Test::Differences. Thanks Karen Etheridge!

1.08    2012-10-08    DOLMEN (Olivier Mengué)

	[ Fixes ]
	- Enforce Test::More 0.88 dependency in the built distribution.
	  This allows to avoid depending on the user using AutoPrereqs to
	  scan our generated test file.
	- Enforce 'version.pm' dependency as a 'develop' dependency in the
	  built distribution. This allows 'version' to be listed in
	  'dzil listdeps --author' as well as this plugin.

1.07    2012-10-08    DOLMEN (Olivier Mengué)

	[ Fixes ]
	- Require a recent version of version.pm (0.9901) to avoid failures
	  in t/3part-prereq.t. As 'version.pm' was not required before, its
	  version was not reported before in t/000-report-version-tiny.t of
	  this distribution, so I don't know exactly which version.pm was
	  failing.

1.06    2012-09-19    DOLMEN (Olivier Mengué)

	[ Fixes ]
	- Use $] instead of $^V for compatibility with older perl. Thanks RJBS!

	[ Meta ]
	- DZ: drop ChangelogFromGit
	- Rewrote 'Changes' in a human readable format instead of a bare git
	  log.

1.05    2012-07-18    DOLMEN (Olivier Mengué)

	[ Fixes ]
	- Fixed RT#67127 and other various things. See git log for details.
	- Thanks KENTNL (Kent Frederic), MITHALDU, RSTAUNER (Randy Stauner)
	  and APOCALYPSE!

	[ Features ]
	- Add 'include' option. Thanks RSTAUNER (Randy Stauner) and KENTNL
	  (Kent Fredric)!

	[ Tests ]

	- Cleanup test dependencies (DOLMEN):
